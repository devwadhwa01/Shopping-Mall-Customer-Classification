# Shopping-Mall-Customer-Classification

The shopping center retailers work in a profoundly serious retail condition which requires successful administration so as to fulfill the clients and accomplish clients' steadfastness. The purpose of this project is to classify the customers based on annual income and spending score, so as to help retailers in becoming aware of their potential customers and thus to increase profits. The outcomes further give a significant comprehension of the relationship of socioeconomics (age and sexual orientation) on clients' fulfillment levels and shopping habits at the shopping mall. The classification has been done using K-means clustering.
